# small-model

> Opt-in adaptation layer that makes small and local LLMs viable for real coding work — quality monitoring, per-model tuning profiles, session evidence, smart read capping, thinking budgets, and an autonomous supervisor.

## Why this exists

Coding agents are tuned for frontier models. Research shows scaffold–model fit moves a 9.7B model from **19% → 45%** on Aider Polyglot — not a better model, just a better-fitted scaffold. This extension adds that fit to nyma without changing anything for users running Sonnet/Opus.

Everything is **off by default**. Enabling it changes nothing on frontier models unless you also configure profiles. On small/local models it wires a two-tier quality loop, per-model tuning, and an evidence store that keeps context coherent across compaction.

## Quick start

```jsonc
// .nyma/settings.json
{
  "small-model": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

Or for a single session:

```
nyma --ext-small-model --model ollama/qwen2.5-coder
```

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `small-model__EvidenceAdd` | Store a key fact, finding, or progress note that persists across compaction |
| `small-model__EvidenceGet` | Retrieve a stored snippet by key |
| `small-model__EvidenceList` | List all evidence keys with previews |

## Modules

Each module has its own toggle. All are **off by default** when `enabled: true` — except `quality-monitor`, `evidence`, and `profiles` which default on.

### `quality-monitor` (default: on)

Detects and corrects three failure modes small models hit frequently, with **escalating nudges** (Forge pattern — polite → direct → aggressive across 3 tiers):

| Problem | Detection | Tier-1 response | Tier-3 response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Empty / whitespace turns | `stream_filter` abort | "Please continue or report findings" | "STOP. You MUST call a tool or respond() now." |
| Hallucinated tool names | middleware `:leave` | "Tool X doesn't exist. Available: …" | "STOP. You MUST call one of: …" |
| Exact repeat tool calls | middleware `:leave` (cumulative sig set) | "Already ran X. Try something different." | "STOP repeating X. Change the tool or finish." |

Each violation type tracks its own counter independently. Successful turns reset the counters. Quality signals are forwarded to the `supervisor` module for LLM-level escalation.

Also enforces a **turn budget** (`max-turns`, default 40). When the cap is hit, a follow-up message is injected telling the model to stop and report — preventing the CMU "context ceiling" failure mode where sequential reflection degrades past a plateau.

```jsonc
"quality-monitor": {
  "enabled": true,
  "max-turns": 40,
  "no-progress-streak": 3,
  "adaptive-temperature": true
}
```

### `profiles` (default: on)

Maps `"provider/model"` → tuning parameters. Applied automatically each turn via `model_resolve`, `before_provider_request`, and `tool_access_check`.

```jsonc
"profiles": {
  "enabled": true,
  "model-profiles": {
    "ollama/qwen2.5-coder": {
      "contextLimit": 32768,
      "thinking": "off",
      "temperature": 0.2,
      "resultCap": 6000,
      "allowedTools": ["read", "write", "edit", "bash", "glob", "grep"],
      "editStrategy": "patch"
    },
    "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5": {
      "thinking": "low",
      "allowedTools": ["read", "write", "edit", "bash", "glob", "grep", "web_search"]
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Effect |
|---|---|
| `thinking` | Sets thinking level (`off` / `low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh`) via `setThinkingLevel` |
| `temperature` | Injected into `providerOptions` via `before_provider_request` |
| `allowedTools` | Narrows the active tool set for this model (SOTA: tool-call accuracy degrades as toolset grows) |
| `editStrategy` | `"patch"` (default) or `"whole"` — Aider-style per-model edit format selection |

### `evidence` (default: on)

Per-session memory snippets that survive `token_suite` compaction. Use them to record goals, progress, errors, and todo items so the model doesn't lose task context across turns.

Evidence is injected into every system prompt via `before_agent_start`, so it persists through compaction even when old messages are dropped. Schema follows OpenHands' condenser principle: preserve **goals / progress / what's-left / todo**.

```jsonc
"evidence": {
  "enabled": true,
  "max-snippets": 20,
  "max-snippet-chars": 1024
}
```

Typical usage by the model:

```
EvidenceAdd  key="goal"      value="Refactor auth module to use JWT"
EvidenceAdd  key="progress"  value="auth/login.ts done; auth/session.ts next"
EvidenceAdd  key="todo"      value="session.ts, middleware.ts, tests"
EvidenceList  →  shows all snippets
```

### `read-guard` (default: off)

Overrides the built-in `read` tool: when a file exceeds `max-lines` (default 60), returns only the head with a "use grep/glob to find the relevant section, then re-read with a range" directive. Distinct from `token_suite`'s post-hoc truncation — this steers the model toward targeted reads *before* the tokens are spent.

```jsonc
"read-guard": {
  "enabled": true,
  "max-lines": 60
}
```

### `thinking-budget` (default: off)

Caps extended thinking tokens per turn (`thinkingBudget` in `providerOptions`). If the provider returns a budget-overflow error, retries once with thinking disabled. Most useful for models that support extended thinking on cloud providers.

```jsonc
"thinking-budget": {
  "enabled": true,
  "max-tokens": 8000,
  "retry-without-thinking": true
}
```

### `supervisor` (default: off)

Proactive babysitter — the missing half of the `advisor` extension. The advisor is reactive (the model must call it). The supervisor fires automatically on configurable triggers, calls the same `consult-advisor` path under the hood, and injects the returned guidance as a `steer` message.

Implements the **lead/worker split**: `settings.roles.advisor` (typically a stronger or cloud model) supervises the small local worker model.

Triggers:
- **Periodic** — every N turns (`every-n-turns`, default 8)
- **Quality signal** — when `quality_monitor` fires (inter-extension bus)
- **Pre-commit** — before any `git commit` / `git push` / `git merge` bash call
- **Validate failure** — when `validate_repair` reports a test failure (future module)

Bounded by `max-interventions` (default 3) to avoid the "context ceiling" of over-babysitting.

```jsonc
"supervisor": {
  "enabled": true,
  "every-n-turns": 8,
  "max-interventions": 3,
  "pre-commit": true
}
```

Requires the `advisor` extension to be loaded (declared in `dependsOn`).

### `self-tune` (default: off)

ACE-style **online learned playbook**. When the worker (small model) emits a failure
signal, the lead (advisor) reflects on the transcript and distills **one generalizable
rule**, appended as an incremental delta to `<cwd>/.nyma/memory/PLAYBOOK.md`. The playbook
is injected into the worker's system prompt on later turns, so it stops repeating the class
of mistake. This is the missing *learning-across-turns* layer — profiles tune parameters,
evidence remembers task state, self-tune accumulates behavioural rules.

**Failure signals** (what "fails" means — never a crash):
- `quality-signal` from `quality-monitor` — hallucinated tool, exact-repeat call, empty turn.
- `verify-fail` from `verify_gate` — the worker's edit broke the configured test command.

On frontier models none of these fire, so self-tune is inert.

**SOTA basis** (natural-language self-improvement, no weight updates):
- **ACE** (Agentic Context Engineering, arXiv 2510.04618): +10.6% on agents; a smaller open
  model matched the top production AppWorld agent. Updates MUST be **append+dedup deltas**,
  not block-rewrites — naive rewriting causes *context collapse / brevity bias*. self-tune's
  store dedups near-duplicates and caps oldest-out for exactly this reason.
- **TT-D** (arXiv 2510.07841): a stronger model distilling lessons to the weak student —
  +5.48% avg, 68× fewer samples. nyma's advisor→worker split *is* TT-D.
- **GEPA** (ICLR 2026 oral), **Reflexion/Self-Refine**: reflective NL evolution beats RL at
  a fraction of the rollouts.

Reflection is bounded: it fires only after `min-failures` accumulate and stops at
`max-reflections` per session (the supervisor's context-ceiling guard). Reuses
`supervisor/call-advisor-tool` for the advisor call and `before_agent_start` for injection —
no new leader plumbing. Requires the `advisor` extension.

```jsonc
"self-tune": {
  "enabled": false,
  "max-lessons": 20,               // playbook cap; oldest evicted
  "min-failures": 2,               // reflect only after N signals
  "max-reflections": 3,            // advisor-call budget per session
  "reflect-on": ["quality-signal", "verify-fail"]
}
```

      "pre-commit": true
    }
  }
}
```

### `respond-tool` (default: off)

Synthetic `respond` tool from [Forge](https://github.com/antoinezambelli/forge) — the technique that moved an 8B model from single-digit to **84%** on structured tool-calling benchmarks.

Small models (~8B) cannot reliably choose between returning bare text and calling a tool. Without guidance they frequently produce bare text when the agent loop expects a tool call, or call tools when they should be responding. Injecting `respond(message)` forces every output through a structured path: the model MUST either call a real tool or call `respond()` to reply.

**Nyma-native implementation** (cleaner than Forge's proxy approach):

1. `before_provider_request` — inject `respond` into the tools map
2. Middleware `:leave` — when `respond` fires, save the message arg and set a flag
3. Next `before_provider_request` — return `{:block true, :reason message}`, which the loop (loop.cljs:208–213) stores as a clean assistant message and emits `agent_end`

The `respond` tool call is stripped from message storage via `message_before_store`, so from the user's perspective the exchange looks like a normal text response.

```jsonc
"respond-tool": {
  "enabled": true
}
```

## Capabilities

`events`, `model`, `context`, `middleware`, `tools`, `tools-override`, `flags`, `commands`, `state`, `messages`

## What's not here (and why)

| Technique | Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Tool-result truncation | **Exists** in `token_suite` | Don't rebuild |
| Context compaction / folding | **Exists** in `token_suite` | Don't rebuild |
| Model switching | **Exists** in `model_roles` | Don't rebuild |
| Rescue parsing (Qwen XML / Mistral bracket-tag) | **In `custom_provider_local`** | Lives at the provider layer; enable per-entry with `rescueParsing: true` |
| Guided/constrained decoding | **Deferred** | High value; needs provider `:fetch` hook + opt-in due to "Format Tax" |
| Edit→validate→repair loop | **Deferred** | SELF-REFINE pattern; needs configured test command |
| Step enforcer (required\_steps + prerequisites) | **Deferred** | Forge's `StepEnforcer` is the blueprint; maps well to nyma's `tool_access_check` |
| Apply-model delegation (Fast-Apply) | **Deferred** | Needs a separate fast-apply endpoint |
| Agentless pipeline mode | **Deferred** | Different scaffold; large scope |
